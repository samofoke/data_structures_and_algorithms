/*
- linear search takes a lot of steps.
- Big O notation we look how many steps our program will take O(N).
- Big O is also known as having linear time.
- Big O focuses on the worst case scenaio.
- We look at he Big O in terms of Binary Search.
- So in this case we have O(N), O(log N) and O(1).
- Sowe just saying that Big O is just log2(N) which is just
- log base 2 N elements (N).
